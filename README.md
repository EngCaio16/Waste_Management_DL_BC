## Waste Classification Using Deep Learning with Data Augmentation

In this project, I implemented a deep learning model for binary image classification to determine whether waste is organic or recyclable. Using the **Waste Classification Dataset** from Kaggle, the model classifies waste items into two categories: **organic** and **recyclable**. The dataset contains various images of waste materials, and I used **data augmentation techniques** to enhance the diversity of training data, improving the model's generalization and robustness.

### Model Architecture and Data Augmentation

The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), optimized to recognize visual patterns that differentiate organic waste from recyclable items. Given the limited dataset, I applied data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and brightness adjustment. This increases the effective size of the dataset by introducing variability, helping the model learn a broader range of features and avoid overfitting.

### Importance to Society

Proper waste classification is essential for effective waste management and environmental conservation. By automating the classification process with deep learning:

1. **Efficiency in Waste Sorting**: Sorting waste accurately and quickly is challenging in waste facilities. This model could assist in automating that process, reducing manual sorting and associated costs.
  
2. **Environmental Impact**: Incorrect waste disposal can lead to contamination in recycling streams and increase landfill usage. Accurate classification supports more sustainable waste practices, leading to higher recycling rates and reduced landfill impact.
  
3. **Public Awareness and Cleaner Communities**: Classification technologies can be implemented in public spaces to educate and encourage proper waste disposal practices, contributing to cleaner environments and promoting sustainable habits within communities.

### Future Applications

Expanding this model for multiclass classification (e.g., plastic, metal, paper) or integrating it with IoT devices could enable real-time waste management solutions in smart cities, benefiting both local ecosystems and global environmental goals.
